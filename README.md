# nba-2019-hackathon
A submission towards the NBA 2019 Business Analysis hackathon.

The NBA organizes the hackathon every year and I only found about it 5 days prior to last date of submission. 
This challenge consists of analyzing Instagram posts by the official NBA account and predicting the number of engagements each post generates.
This is a regression problem and I built the entire machine learning pipeline from initial exploratory data analysis to model building and final test predictions.
